Title: Making libmaple compile faster

Recently, we've been playing around with ways to get [libmaple][] to
compile faster. We've been able to get good results (0.1 seconds for a
full build); this post summarizes them. Results were obtained with the
[UNIX toolchain][], but it might be interesting to try to port them over
to the [IDE][]. All timing results are for building [blinky.cpp][] on
today's libmaple master ([0cc911c][]) using a quad-core hyper-threaded
CPU (an Intel i7-3770 at 3.4 GHz).

TLDR:

1.  Use make's -j flag to parallelize the build
2.  Use ccache to save old build files

</p>
<!--more-->**Use make's `-j` flag for parallel builds:** this one is a
no-brainer.

Building with `make -jN` allows N separate jobs (e.g. compilations) to
proceed at the same time. The "right" value of N depends on the computer
you're using to build libmaple; we usually use the common heuristic N =
number of cores.

Without -j:

<p>
~~~~ {style="padding-left: 30px;"}
$ time make[...]real   0m3.570suser 0m2.664ssys  0m0.400s
~~~~

</p>
That's 3.570 seconds of wall clock time. With -j8:

<p>
~~~~ {style="padding-left: 30px;"}
$ time make -j8[...]real  0m0.825suser 0m3.788ssys  0m0.476s
~~~~

</p>
0.825 seconds, or a little **more than a 4x speedup**. (`make -j4`
usually results in \~1 second builds; increasing N beyond 8 seems to
have little effect.)

**Use ccache to cache old build files:** We recommend this in general,
but it really shines if you use more than one kind of Maple board
(regular Maple, Maple Mini, etc.) or have to `make clean` a lot for some
other reason.

[ccache][] is a compiler cache. It saves the results of old
compilations, letting you reuse them even if you've deleted the versions
in the libmaple build directory. Since you have to run `make clean`
before rebuilding libmaple when switching boards, having a cache of
libmaple's object files for the other board saves time when you switch
back.

Results using ccache with an empty cache:

<p>
~~~~ {style="padding-left: 30px;"}
$ time make[...]real 0m4.489suser 0m3.056ssys  0m0.488s
~~~~

</p>
Running it multiple times, it seems that this number (\~4.5 seconds) is
typical. Note that that's a little under a second more than building
libmaple without ccache. The extra time is presumably spent warming up
the cache.

The results when rebuilding libmaple with a warm cache are pretty
impressive:

<p>
~~~~ {style="padding-left: 30px;"}
$ make clean; time makereal 0m0.352suser 0m0.064ssys  0m0.040s
~~~~

</p>
That's **more than a 10x speedup** over rebuilding libmaple without
ccache.

If you'd like to try this for yourself, you can use the following
libmaple patch:

<p>
~~~~ {style="padding-left: 30px;"}
diff --git a/support/make/build-rules.mk b/support/make/build-rules.mkindex 3d541ba..1a2abbb 100644--- a/support/make/build-rules.mk+++ b/support/make/build-rules.mk@@ -1,9 +1,9 @@ # Useful tools-CC       := arm-none-eabi-gcc-CXX      := arm-none-eabi-g+++CC       := ccache arm-none-eabi-gcc+CXX      := ccache arm-none-eabi-g++ LD       := arm-none-eabi-ld -v AR       := arm-none-eabi-ar-AS       := arm-none-eabi-gcc+AS       := ccache arm-none-eabi-gcc OBJCOPY  := arm-none-eabi-objcopy DISAS    := arm-none-eabi-objdump OBJDUMP  := arm-none-eabi-objdump
~~~~

</p>
(Save the patch to a file, then run `$ git apply the-file-name` from
within libmaple).

**Parting shot**: the combination of the two (make -j8 plus warm cache):

<p>
~~~~ {style="padding-left: 30px;"}
$ make clean; time make -j8[...]real    0m0.132suser 0m0.064ssys  0m0.020s
~~~~

</p>
About a**27x speedup** overÂ  plain `make`. Which is awesome, but note
that it's less than the product of the speedups of using -j8 (4x) and
ccache (10x). Presumably the fixed overhead is non-parallelizable,
non-cacheable build tasks like the final link.
