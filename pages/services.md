LeafLabs provides contract engineering and consulting services to businesses,
startups, academic groups, and institutions. We span a "full stack" of digital
electronics prototyping; our preferred approach is to integrate proven and
familar open source hardware components, firmware, and host software (much of
our own design) to deliver both small batch instrumentation and
production-ready prototypes at lower cost.
