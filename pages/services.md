LeafLabs provides contract engineering and consulting services to
businesses, startups, academic groups, and institutions. Our skill set
spans a "full stack" of digital electronics. Our preferred approach is
to integrate proven and familiar open source hardware components,
firmware, and host software (much of our own design) to deliver both
small volume and production-ready designs.
