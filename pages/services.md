LeafLabs provides contract engineering and consulting services to corporations,
startups, academic groups, and institutions. We span a "full stack" of digital
electronics prototyping; our unique approach is to integrate proven and familar
open source hardware components, firmware, and host software (much of our own
design) to deliver both small batch instrumentation and production-ready
prototypes at lower cost.
