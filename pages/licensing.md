Title: Licensing
Slug: licensing

We feel strongly that our users deserve the full freedom to learn from, exploit, and extend the hardware and software tools that we provide.  We also believe that anybody should have the freedom to adopt, reuse, or imitate these tools for any purpose, without having to worry about licensing conflicts.

Acting on these beliefs, we have selected the most permissive licenses possible for our software tools (while respecting the licenses of software projects we have directly branched from), and have released our hardware designs (including the raw gerber blueprints rendered for manufacturing) under a Creative Commons share-a-like license.

Much ink has been spilt on the subject of Free and Open Source Software and Hardware.  Appropriately enough, Wikipedia is a great place to get some context (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware">Open Source Hardware</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">Copyleft</a>, etc). We would like to thank the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, and many others for legally enabling our business model.

Our devices and software would not be feasible without decades of generous effort by hackers from around the world. Some of the projects we directly build off of are:
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> development board and programming environment, which in turn inherits from <a href="http://www.wiring.org.co/">Wiring</a> and <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a></li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.openmoko.com/">OpenMoko</a> project's <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Dfu-util">dfu-util</a> USB firmware flashing utility</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> compiler and the rest of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> toolchain</li>
	<li>Modifications to the arm-none-eabi GCC target by <a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm">Codesourcery, Inc.</a></li>
	<li>The <a href="http://kicad.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Kicad</a> circuit layout software suite</li>
</ul>
We would also like to credit a few projects we find inspirational: <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/">ladyada</a>, <a href="http://www3.elphel.com/">elphel</a>, <a href="http://sparkfun.com">sparkfun</a>, and of course <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>.
