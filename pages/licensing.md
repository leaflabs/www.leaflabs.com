Title: Licensing

</p>

We feel strongly that our users deserve the full freedom to learn from,
exploit, and extend the hardware and software tools that we provide. We
also believe that anybody should have the freedom to adopt, reuse, or
imitate these tools for any purpose, without having to worry about
licensing conflicts.

Acting on these beliefs, we have selected the most permissive licenses
possible for our software tools (while respecting the licenses of
software projects we have directly branched from), and have released our
hardware designs (including the raw gerber blueprints rendered for
manufacturing) under a Creative Commons share-a-like license.

Much ink has been spilt on the subject of Free and Open Source Software
and Hardware. Appropriately enough, Wikipedia is a great place to get
some context (see [Open Source][], [Open Source
Hardware][], [Copyleft][], etc). We would like to thank the [Free
Software Foundation][], the [Electronic Frontier
Foundation][], [Creative Commons][], and many others for legally
enabling our business model.

Our devices and software would not be feasible without decades of
generous effort by hackers from around the world. Some of the projects
we directly build off of are:

-   The [Arduino][] development board and programming environment, which
    in turn inherits from [Wiring][] and [Processing][]
-   The [OpenMoko][] project's [dfu-util][] USB firmware flashing
    utility
-   The [GCC][] compiler and the rest of the [GNU][] toolchain
-   Modifications to the arm-none-eabi GCC target by [Codesourcery,
    Inc.][]
-   The [Kicad][] circuit layout software suite

</p>
We would also like to credit a few projects we find
inspirational: [ladyada][], [elphel][], [sparkfun][], and of
course [Arduino][1].
