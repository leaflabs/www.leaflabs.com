<h2>Overview</h2>
<span id="internal-source-marker_0.9579798097256571">Research misconduct involving <a href="http://www.usphs.gov/">Public Health Service</a> (PHS) support is contrary to the interests of the PHS and the Federal government and to the health and safety of the public, to the integrity of research, and to the conservation of public funds. As a business that applies for and/or receives PHS funding, LeafLabs shares responsibility for the integrity of the research process. This document is official company policy regarding research misconduct at the workplace in compliance with 42 CFR 93, 42 CFR 50, and 42 CFR 94, as applicable.</span>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Research misconduct</strong> is fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.</li>
	<li><strong>Fabrication </strong>is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.</li>
	<li><strong>Falsification</strong> is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plagiarism</span> is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.</li>
</ul>

<span id="internal-source-marker_0.9579798097256571">Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion. A finding of research misconduct requires significant departure from the accepted practices of the relevant research community. The misconduct must be committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, and any allegations must be proven by a preponderance of evidence.</span>
