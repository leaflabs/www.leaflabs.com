Our <a href="/devices/#Maple">Maple</a> board consists of the essentials: a fast processor with lots of peripherals. At the center of Maple is a 72MHz ARM Cortex M3 chip, providing the increased computational power desired by more advanced users. In the past, ARM processors were notoriously unfriendly in non-professional environments due to proprietary tool chains and unfamiliar instruction sets. Because of this, they were conspicuously absent from classrooms and hobbyists' workbenches. Leaf aims to change this by providing an ARM tool-chain built from open source components and a programming environment that is intuitively easy to use. For those of us who love and are familiar with Arduino, Maple is offered in an Arduino-compatible format, complete with Arduino pin layouts and programming environment. In the future, a Cortex native version will be available in order to take full advantage of this fantastic micro-controller.

<strong>Note: </strong>The Maple does not come with the USB cable (mini-B style) required to power or upload programs using the USB bus. You can buy these from most local electronics/convenience stores, or quite likely have one lying around for use with a cellphone or other USB device.

<a href="/devices/#Maple-Mini">Maple Mini</a> is a breadboard compatible version of Maple with a small form factor. Despite its low cost and small size, it carries substantial processing power on board.

<strong>Note: </strong>The Maple Mini does not come with the USB cable (mini-B style) required to power or upload programs using the USB bus. You can buy these from most local electronics/convenience stores, or quite likely have one lying around for use with a cellphone or other USB device.
