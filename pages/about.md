LeafLabs was founded in 2009 on the premise that science should not just be
confined to expensive labs filled with shiny equipment, but also found on
cluttered workbenches in musty basements everywhere. We are dedicated to making
the latest in computer science and electrical engineering accessible to all
engineers, regardless of budget or specialized training. 

The company got its start developing and selling a user-friendly physical
computing board built around a new-to-market ARM Cortex-M3 32-bit
microcontroller. These controllers were more powerful and had a larger feature
set than the most popular existing 8-bit chips, and were rapidly decreasing in
cost, but were significantly less accessible due to a combined dearth of
toolchain integration, functional and human-readable peripheral libraries, and
hardware platforms that met the common sense expectations of modern folks. After
several production pitfalls and financial droughts, in 2010 the team finally
released the Maple and Maple Mini boards with an open source software
development toolchain.

Around this time most of the team had graduated from college, and some spun off
into high-end audiophilia, theoretical condensed matter physics, and other
such nonsense. The remaining Leafers were joined by Marti and have embarked on
a series of increasingly ambitious and interesting
<a href="/services/">contract jobs</a>.

After first bouncing through dorm rooms and apartments, we moved in to our
first real office space 
<a href="/2010/05/cubicles-and-leopards-and-cliches-oh-my/"> in Spring 2010</a>:
a repurposed cubicle farm in the middle Central Square in Cambridge, MA.
Starting out as the first tenants, we quickly filled the space with like-minded
freelancers and small technical businesses: 3D printing dreamers,
robo-toast-video-calligraphy artists, interaction architects, solar power
hustlers, etc. When that building shut down, we moved a 15 minute walk away to
Inman Square and started <a href="http://industry-lab.com/">Industry Lab</a>,
where we cheerily find ourselves at this very moment:

We do business with component distributors, PCB fabrication factories, and
surface mount assembly houses both in the United States and in China. We are
<i>always, always, always</i> looking for affordable prototype fabrication
services in the New England area (for some definition of "low-cost")... 
[let us know](/contact/) if you have any tips!
