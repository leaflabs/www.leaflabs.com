<h3>Other, Unauthorized Sources</h3>
As of Summer 2010, we've noticed Maple rev1 boards (with the original LeafLabs
silkscreen intact) for sale on the internet from unknown sources.

While our hardware designs are <a
href="https://github.com/leaflabs/maple">freely available</a> under an <a
href="/licensing/">open license</a>, we don't approve of reusing the LeafLabs
brand/logo without permission, and we don't permit implying that a device was
produced or approved by LeafLabs if it was not.

We do encourage derivative projects adapting our hardware designs and software
toolchain, even for commercial purposes, as long as the terms of our licenses
are respected. For hardware, this means attributing us as the original designer
and releasing any modifications under a compatible open license. Along the
lines of our relationship with the Arduino brand, it's fine to mention that a
device is "Maple compatible" or "based on the LeafLabs Oak" if those statements
are true.

If you have any questions please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>!

(Of course it's fine to resell a real LeafLabs board over the internet, as long
as you're honest about it being used. If you're not putting it to work, get it
to someone who will!)

<h3>Become a Distributor!</h3>
We're always looking for new regional and international distributors to reduce
shipping and customs headaches for our customers. Please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:sales@leaflabs.com">sales@leaflabs.com</a> or via the contact form
and we'd be happy to send you an informational packet with bulk prices.
