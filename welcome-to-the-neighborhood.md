How do you begin a blog...

This monday four of your beloved LeafLabbers moved into TREE-house--
TREE standing for The Robots Eat Everyone, obviously. We now live in a
nice yellow house behind a nice picket fence in a nice little
neighborhood between Central and Harvard Squares. Emphasis on nice. At
night  you can hear the traffic from a busy street two blocks away, and
in the day-time people walk their dogs and say hello each other as they
stroll down narrow residential streets. We live in place where people
have birthday parties for children. With balloons. 

Having moved here from the other, less 'nice', side of Central Square
[my part time home; I spent the other half of my time in a little world
called East Campus...], the whole notion of a family friendly
neighborhood is unnerving. I never particularly worried about my safety
in 'da hood' but nor did I worry about having a noise complaint called
on me at nine PM. I feel an odd responsibility to protect our next door
neighbor, her garden, and her bed and breakfast from whatever
bad-influence a bunch of cigarette-smoking, college-aged, full time
nerds and whatever bad influences we may have on the children. 

I guess it's too soon to really say what affect our new semi-responsible
lifestyle will have on us, and LeafLabs, so I'll close this with the
promise of photographic proof of our reformed ways. 

 

Until next time.
