This weekend, we set up a microscope, solder
paste machine, an oven, and an air compressor. They're all in this
photo. I'm really excited about having the solder paste machine. The
first time I tried one, it was as exciting as seeing solder wick onto
component leads for the first time (which was immensely exciting). They
make soldering high-pin-count components cleaner and easier. We needed
the air compressor for the solder paste machine, but we'll use it for
other things too. I'll be assembling the final version of the Maple
prototype here this week before we get a pick-and-placed proof and 100
assembled boards for beta testers.

This is our new cat, Henry.
