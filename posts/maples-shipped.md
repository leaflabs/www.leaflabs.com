Hey all--

Maples are in the mail; hopefully they will arrive this weekend for you
residents of America out there, and some time next week for the
international folks. Our software will be up within the next few days,
just in time to get started hacking on your boards.

So thanks for bearing with us, and Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah,
Killer Kwanzaa, and A yuley Yule to all of you.
