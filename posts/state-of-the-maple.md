Hey guys, as you may have noticed, the LeafLabs store is currently
running pretty low on stock, and we’ve also been making some vague
statements around the forums about the impending move to the F4 line.
So, we just wanted to give everybody a quick heads up on where we are in
terms of product availability and development.

-   **Maple r5** is currently out of stock, but please be assured we
    plan to continue manufacturing and supporting Maple r5 for the
    foreseeable future. We’ve got another run in production so we should
    be carrying them again soon. In the meantime, r5 is still readily
    available from our [distributors][].
-   **Maple Mini** is also out of stock, and will also be manufactured
    and supported for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the Maple
    Mini is sold out at all distributors at the moment, but we do
    currently have another run in production, along with the r5s. Expect
    to see them back in stock within 60 days, maximum.
-   **Maple RET6** is still available, but once this run is gone we do
    not intend on manufacturing more. In general, the RET6 is just not
    terribly popular, and in the future the F4 version should provide
    the “level up” option that made the RET6 appealing. We’re going to
    be selling the remaining stock at a sale price of $44.99, so get
    ‘em while they last.
-   **Maple Native** beta run is over, and we got a lot of good feedback
    about the board. At this point, our intention is to redesign Maple
    Native to support the F4 chip, so there’s going to be a gap in
    availability until the F4 line is ready. A few people have asked
    about form factor compatibility, in the interest of going ahead and
    making shields. The current plan is to keep any future models more
    or less compatible with the beta version. We may end up swapping out
    the unpopulated 3x16 header at the end of the board for a high
    density header. If you’ve got concerns about changes, please don’t
    hesitate to drop us a line.
-   **Maple II** is our up-and-coming F4 line board! We’re hard at work
    retooling libmaple to support F4, and finalizing the hardware
    design. Expect a post soon with more details on what we’re planning,
    and a chance for feedback.
-   **Oak** is also still in development -- we haven’t forgotten about
    it, we promise! Unfortunately, Oak development tends to take second
    fiddle to Maple issues, so progress has been slower than we’d like.
    At this point, we have a mostly-functional prototype in house and we
    are working on bringing up all the peripherals. Currently, the plan
    is also to use an F4 on Oak.

Thanks for your continuing support of LeafLabs and Maple. We hope you’re
as excited about the new projects as we are.
