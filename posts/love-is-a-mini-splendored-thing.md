Good news, everyone! The first batch of Maple Minis have arrived, and
we've released [Maple IDE 0.0.11][] to officially support them!

![][]

While we've got a whole bundle of them on the way, the first hundred
boards came early (long story). To celebrate, we're going to be
**[selling these first hundred at the low low price of \$24.99][]**,
\$10 off the usual price (\$34.99 for those of us who are bad at math).
So hurry to the [store][] and get yours right away!

If you're new to LeafLabs and this is the first you're hearing about the
Mini, head to the [devices page][] for more information. (The [Mini's
hardware docs page][] has all the gory details). Don't forget, you'll
need to grab the [0.0.11 IDE][Maple IDE 0.0.11] in order to play with
the Mini.
