We've cooked up Maple Mini which has fewer pins but the same amount of
SRAM and flash memory as the original Maple. It's breadboard compatible
and smaller than a stick of gum! We hope to slap a super nifty
silkscreen on it and, after we test the snot out of it, have some in the
store in a couple months.

Here it is hanging out in its home, the breadboard:
