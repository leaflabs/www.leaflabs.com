If you're reading this our new web server
must be working! Today we've transfered the leaflabs.com DNS records
over, including all of our email, web applications, documentation, etc.
There are definitely a couple rough edges and it might take a couple
hours for the changes to propagate, but hopefully things will be
snappier and cleaner now. We're even (partially) [IPv6][] compatible,
thanks to a tunnel from [Hurricane Electric][].

We've imported all the old comments and [forum][] posts. You now have
the option to use a valid [OpenID][] to post blog comments, but that
didn't work smoothly for the forums so you'll need to register a new
account there. Sorry!

We've added a [documentation][] section, a [community page][],
consolidated information about our [licensing][], and more. Let us know
if you find any bugs or broken links!
