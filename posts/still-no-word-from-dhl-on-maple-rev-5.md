Our shipment of Maples is still in transit.Â  Feel free to try any of the
following distributors; these are known to have them in stock:

-   [SeeedStudio][]
-   [RobotShop][]
-   [Lawicel][]

If you've already ordered from us, and would like to order from a
distributor instead (or if you're just tired of waiting), just send us
an [email][] from the address you gave to PayPal when you ordered, and
we'll issue you a full refund.
