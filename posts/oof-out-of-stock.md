The long debate over how to space the 18 pin header on the new Maple
dragged on just a hair too long. We are really happy with the new
layout, 1/10" spacing everywhere and no major sacrifices to do it.
However, this puts us about 2 weeks behind on fab for Maple Rev5. Just
like Maple Rev2, we skipped over Rev4 to make these layout changes
before fab.

With any luck we will have some Rev5's to show (not sell) at Maker
Faire! We will also bring the last remaining handful of Rev3's for
people to pick up, and hopefully some cool demos. Rev5's will be open to
preorders at the Faire! Lead time should be quick, 20 days ish.

A big thanks to everyone participating on the forums! gbulmer,
leaflabsAndy, amir, crenn, StephenFromNYC, x893, adamfeuer, and others -
you guys are the best! Together weve brought up I2C, cleared a ton of
bugs out, made some round table design decisions, and shared a whole lot
of enthusiasm. 1335 posts and counting, and nearly as many unique users!
We couldnt have asked for a better set of early adopters. For those of
you who are waiting for the Maple platform to get a little more mature -
thanks to these guys and the great work around the office, LeafLabs is
growing up faster than we could have hoped! Thanks!

And now for something cool - *Made With Maple*

[THX - Maple Style][]
