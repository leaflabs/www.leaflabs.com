We have switched to a new website backend, using
[Pelican](http://getpelican.com) to statically generate HTML files. As noted
[last week](http://forums.leaflabs.com/topic.php?id=10227), we don't have a
mechanism for direct comments on posts right here any more, so please
discuss this post (and future ones) in the forums
[here](http://forums.leaflabs.com/forum.php?id=11)! There was not a direct way
to keep old comments attached to their pages, but they have been archived and
are accessible via a link at the bottom of every blog post.

If you subscribe to our RSS feed, the URL should not have changed, but slight
changes in XML syntax may mean you get spammed by a re-listing of all our old
posts. Sorry in advance!

I did my best to re-point image references and preserve old post URLs; if
anything breaks please [drop us a line](/contact).
