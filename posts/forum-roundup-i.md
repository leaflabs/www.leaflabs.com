A couple of days ago, our [thriving forums][] hit [4000 posts][]. We
thought that was pretty cool, and we also thought that with the forums
moving so quickly these days, it could be easy to miss something really
exciting. To help you avoid that tragedy, we've decided to start doing
Forum Roundups, bringing you all the highlights from the previous week's
forum chatter. Here's some of the fun stuff that's been happening in the
past week.

-   [Brushless DC motor drivers][] using Maple. [crenn][] is working on
    twin-bladed vertical take-off and landing for a class project. You
    can see a video of the motor being driven [here.][]
-   [Silntknight][] is using a Maple to control the valves on a Briggs &
    Stratton 3.5 HP engine. There's a detailed and fascinating
    discussion of the power electronics involved in [this thread.][]
-   [anton][] and [ridgebackred][] work to get the Maple IDE working
    with the [STM32 Discovery board.][] (Of course we'd rather you buy a
    Maple...!) You can check out their work [here][] on github.
-   Design files for a [Maple protoshield board][] from [Adam][]. Sounds
    like the boards have been sent off to fab... can't wait to see how
    they turn out.
-   Buried [deep in a thread][] about Minis (and a whole bunch of other
    stuff), [gbulmer][] reveals a Maple-influenced robot controller
    board he's been working on (thought you could sneak it by us, huh?).
    You can read his blog post about it [here.][1] Very cool.

    <p>
-   From [StephenFromNYC][], USB Observations Parts [I][], [II][], and
    [III.][] (More than a week old, but worth the read.)
-   Much more than a week old, but too cool to not include: [Xavier's][]
    [FM synth][] project. You can hear it in action [here.][2]

</p>
And that's it for this week's roundup. Did we miss something awesome?
