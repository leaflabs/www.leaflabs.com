Some time last week we broke the 1000 post mark in the forums! We've got some amazing members dispensing advice, code, bug reports, and spelling suggestions. Thank you so much! It's exciting and very motivating to have an experienced set of users using our tools and shaking out any problems. We're looking for a good way to open up our ticketing system for bugs and feature requests to make the development process even more transparent and open to comment.

The heat has finally broken in New England and we're looking forward to trundling down the road to New York City in two weeks for the Open Hardware Summit/Maker Faire NYC double ticket. We'll be in town Thursday debating open hardware principles and practicalities at the Open Hardware Summit, then will have a table with projects and demonstrations at Maker Faire on Saturday and Sunday. If you're in the area or traveling for either event drop by and say Hi, we love to chat up internet people and would be happy to poke at some projects or debug code!

Lastly, you'll notice a new projects link at the top of the website for a projects section. We're hoping this page will grow and include projects written up by us and others demonstrating all the documented and "unofficial" capabilities of our boards and will be a place people can go to looking for practical tips and secret tricks. If you've got something to show off involving a LeafLabs board (or anything compatible/derived) we'd love to include; shoot us a link and brief description <a href="/contact/">here</a>!
