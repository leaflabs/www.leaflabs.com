Slug: wiki-launched

We've just launched our own wiki at [http://wiki.leaflabs.com][]. The decision
was brought about because of [a thread on our forums in support of a wiki][]
for everyone to contribute to. **Well...we think its a good idea too!**

We'd like to invite everyone interested to [register at our new wiki][] and
contribute their experiences. It's a free-for-all at the moment, but we may
nominate a few of our more helpful community members to be moderators in the
near future.

Thank you for the feedback, and remember to *edit responsibly*.
