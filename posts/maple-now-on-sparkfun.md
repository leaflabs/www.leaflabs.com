Over the past year, we have been accumulating a strong list of
distributors. Today we are very excited to add [SparkFun][] (US) and
[Watterott Electronic][] (Germany) to this group!

We have tried our best to choose our distributors carefully and get a
good distribution around the globe, so you may want to check out our
[distributors][] page to find your favorite online depot or discover a
distributor in your region (and save on those VAT taxes!)
