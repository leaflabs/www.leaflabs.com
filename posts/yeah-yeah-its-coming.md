Silly customs glitched our release timing going on 9 days now! ugh!
We've been using the extra days to polish up the arduino-port. The
principle hiccups have been portability on mac/linux/windows. We usually
play in linux, so thats the trivial build. However, Maple depends on
dfu-util (from openMoko) and arm-eabi-gcc (codesourcery) and getting
these to play nice on the other platforms has been headache. Fear not,
all will be righted in the coming days. Were sorry for the delay, the
second we've got a base application for you to play with were going to
open it up to the open source community to hack on. For now, its just a
smash-up of arduino and our stm32 build environment, but we hope that
together we can make it oh so much more!
