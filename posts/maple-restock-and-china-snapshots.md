After a couple logistical hiccups, we finally shipped out fresh Maple boards to
distributors, and a batch of Maple Minis are expected to go out next week. All
distributors have been out of stock for many weeks now, and we want to make it
clear that the blame lies with us, not our manufacturing and distribution
partners. Sorry about that!

You might wonder just where our boards are actually manufactured; I certainly
did! During a personal trip to China this past January I was able to visit
Shenzhen and <a href="http://seeedstudios.com">Seeedstudios</a>, the company
that has handled sourcing, PCB fabrication, assembly, and testing for the Maple
product line for the past several years.

It's impressive how much Seeed has grown in the past few years. They have a
small army of young engineers and designers prototyping new devices, and
multiple lines for prototyping, testing, and assembly. I liked the space they
are working in now: an entire floor of a large industrial building. Not very
sexy, but solid, well lit, and with plenty of room for projects, heavy
equipment, and toys. Compared to the shiny, expensive, and heavily marketed
"incubator hubs" and "innovation centers" in Silicon Valley or Cambridge's
Kendall Square, I think this type of older building is much more valuable
resource for growing companies who need space of their own to grow and
experiment.

Of course "no trip would be complete" without a visit to the famous electronics
markets...
