Welcome to the LeafLabs development blog, brought to you by the LeafLabs
team. You may be wondering, "What *is* LeafLabs?". We're a start-up
based in Massachusetts aiming to bring hardware prototyping to the
masses. We are making hardware and software for the rapid development of
projects that can benefit from the cooperation of a microprocessor and
an FPGA in the same computational framework.

Our software suite is just starting to take shape, and we will be
releasing components of the design software as it becomes stable enough
for public testing (contact be-a-beta-tester@leaflabs.com for more
information). In July, our hardware - informally dubbed LeafBoards -
will be in alpha release, undergoing rigorous testing by our trusted
alpha-users. As soon as August, our first public hardware release
(code-name: "Marilyn") will go on sale, and you can join the
open-hardware movement.

We'll be posting our experiences and thoughts all throughout
development, so stay tuned.
