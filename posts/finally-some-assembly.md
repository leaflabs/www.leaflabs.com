In the middle of October we shipped the Maple components off to Gold
Pheonix for assembly. It was an exciting day and we could hardly wait
the two weeks to see the finished product. As we tracked our package
across the world our excitement turned to panic. The components spent a
few stagnant days in customs - I naively called this "customs glitch."
Days turned to weeks, our 15 day turnaround went from a plan to a
fantasy to an impossibility. However, I am pleased to copy below the
update i posted on the home page:

<strong>

After a VERY long stint in customs, Gold Pheonix has FINALLY received
the components for assembly [sometime between friday afternoon and
monday morning]. We expect a one week turn around on this. We had
originally allocated 15 days lead time for manufacturing our first run
of 100 Maples - due to bureaucratic overhead and some naivete on our
part, 15 days proved to be a massive underestimate. However, were are
pleased to learn that the first run of Maple's are currently under the
pick and place being assembled!. We offer our sincerest apologies for
the delay. To those who have contacted us directly about this issue,
thanks for your understanding and support! </strong>
