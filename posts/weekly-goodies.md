We got a big new batch of Maple rev3 boards in a couple days ago... we
got Nintendo style with this batch and have pushed the heck out of the
buttons on every board we will ship to make sure they aren't "sticky";
doves cried tears of sorrow when a few people got finiky boards in the
last batch. We also built a head-crab style zombie Maple to test the
connectivity of every single GPIO pin:

These boards are on sale in our [shop][] and now also available through
our first distributor [RobotShop][]. Check out the [awesome Maple
graphic][] they made! If you're a distributor who would like to stock
Maple we'd love to talk to you, especially if you are overseas; hit up
our [contact form][].

I finally wrote up a [quickstart][] for programming the Maple from the
Unix command line; this setup makes it easier to track the most recent
changes to libmaple and even contribute patches. As a bonus I also got
[Code::Blocks][] working as an alternative to the Maple IDE:

We'll leave you with this kick ass project video from okie; what kinds
of hackery have you been up to with your Maples?
