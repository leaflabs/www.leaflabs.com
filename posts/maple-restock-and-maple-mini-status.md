We've been receiving lots of emails and forum posts asking about when
we'll have new Maples in stock, and when the Maple Mini will be out. So
far, we've just been responding "as soon as we can get them to you!";
here are some more details on why there have been delays.

Regarding the Maple, we received word from our manufacturer over the
weekend that the yield rate on the new Maple runs was unacceptably low.
The failure rate was traced down to bad button connections. We're
working with them as much as possible to discover how the problem arose,
and how to prevent it in the future.

The first batch of Maple Minis has been manufactured, but it's taken a
little longer than we anticipated to get the test procedure up, running,
and streamlined. These issues were resolved with changes to our testing
documentation, and a generalized "test session" program (which was made
public in [this libmaple commit][]).  This revised test program should
be sufficient to accommodate all future Maple-style boards. To the best
of our knowledge, the Minis are currently undergoing testing at the
manufacturer.

We will continue to keep you updated with any news as it arrives. 
Thanks to everyone for your patience!
