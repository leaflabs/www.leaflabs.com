Our [Maple][2] board consists of the essentials: a fast processor with
lots of peripherals. At the center of Maple is a 72MHz ARM Cortex M3
chip, providing the increased computational power desired by more
advanced users. In the past, ARM processors were notoriously unfriendly
in non-professional environments due to proprietary tool chains and
unfamiliar instruction sets. Because of this, they were conspicuously
absent from classrooms and hobbyists' workbenches. Leaf aims to change
this by providing an ARM tool-chain built from open source components
and a programming environment that is intuitively easy to use. For those
of us who love and are familiar with Arduino, Maple is offered in an
Arduino-compatible format, complete with Arduino pin layouts and
programming environment. In the future, a Cortex native version will be
available in order to take full advantage of this fantastic
micro-controller.

**Note:**The Maple does not come with the USB cable (mini-B style)
required to power or upload programs using the USB bus. You can buy
these from most local electronics/convenience stores, or quite likely
have one lying around for use with a cellphone or other USB device.

For a short list of known issues with this revision of the Maple (rev5),

[Maple Mini][5] is a breadboard compatible version of Maple with a small
form factor. Despite its low cost and small size, it carries substantial
processing power on board.

**Note:**The Maple Mini does not come with the USB cable (mini-B style)
required to power or upload programs using the USB bus. You can buy
these from most local electronics/convenience stores, or quite likely
have one lying around for use with a cellphone or other USB device.
