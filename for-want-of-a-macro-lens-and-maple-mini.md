Soon, someone with more equipment (and certainly more talent) than I
have will replace these pictures with some real photos. But, a \*few\*
Maple Mini's came back from fab today and I just couldn't help myself. I
only had two lenses, a 500mm telephoto and some other zoom lens (200mm?)
- point being I had to take these while standing about 6 feet away.
Enjoy the day's eye candy!
