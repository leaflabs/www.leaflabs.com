# URLs

The URL of a "page" (not a blog post) is based on it's "slug", which is either
deduced from the title of the page or from the 'slug' metadata attribute.

The URL of a "post" (not a page) is based on both the date (specified in
metadata) and the slug (based on the title, or overwritten in metadata).
