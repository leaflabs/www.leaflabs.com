We're still waiting, too.

Due to a shipping mix-up, we're still waiting on our first run of Maple
rev 5's to arrive.  If you ordered a board directly from our website and
still haven't received it, don't worry! Your board is on the way, and
we'll get it to you as fast as we can.  We've emailed you letting you
know that your order is complete, and we'll post on the blog when the
new run arrives.
