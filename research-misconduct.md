interests of the PHS and the Federal government and to the health and
safety of the public, to the integrity of research, and to the
conservation of public funds. As a business that applies for and/or
receives PHS funding, LeafLabs shares responsibility for the integrity
of the research process. This document is official company policy
regarding research misconduct at the workplace in compliance with 42 CFR
93, 42 CFR 50, and 42 CFR 94, as applicable.</span>
